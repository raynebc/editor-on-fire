	Changed the program executable's name to "foflc"
	Fixed a bug with the MIDI import's lyric overlap correction that would cause a lyric that overlapped into a new line phrase to be discarded
	Corrected the grouping behavior of pitch shifts, which now inherit the grouping of the lyric before them
	Altered the linker options for the program, as it seems that some GCC library wasn't being linked into the executable, resulting in a dll dependency
	Eliminated remaining use of calloc() in favor of guaranteed methods to initialize data to a value of 0
	Fixed a minor optimization warning given by GCC regarding some debug logging code

	Optimized ID3 frame exclusion logic (excluding frames whose info. is defined in input file, or frames specified with nosrctag)
	Added additional logic so that the use of nosrctag as a wildcard will omit the ID3v1 tag contents from the source MP3
	Restored the ability to use the track "PART VOCALS" for vocal rhythm, since the detection logic now bases detection on more than the track name
	Lessened the use of calloc() to initialize allocated memory, as this could possibly cause a malfunction with some (currently unidentified) compilers or platforms that don't use all bits clear to represent 0 for some data types

Changelog: 2.31 to 2.32
	Updated to GCC 4.5.0 and made minor changes to resolve compiler warnings
	Fixed a bug with ID3 parsing that wouldn't accept a frame that extended all the way to the end of the tag (ie. if it had no padding)

	Fixed a bug with the notenames handling that would cause pitch names for notes in octave -1 (pitches 0 through 11) to be written incorrectly (vrhythm export)
	Fixed a bug with the previous command line optimizations that would cause the program to try to load vocal rhythm from the pitched lyrics file instead of the MIDI file
	Fixed a file I/O error during ID3 import where the input file would be closed more than once if lyrics weren't found, resulting in the program detecting an error and aborting

	File detection is now skipped unless detection is requested, if automatically detecting the input format or if the requested import fails
	Improved ELRC detection.  Even if the first lyric line in an LRC file has only one timestamp, other lines will be checked for the presence of multiple timestamps (ELRC)
	Added some more variable checking and ensured that all variables are now properly initialized, which should help prevent undiscovered bugs
	Consolidated debug output for MPEG frame parsing

	Fixed memory leaks in UltraStar and ID3 imports
	Corrected program behavior to not create an empty output file during ID3 export if the source MP3 doesn't exist
	Added logic to track a lyric's overdrive and freestyle status separately.  Lyrics that import as both freestyle AND overdrive will export as such whenever possible (pitched lyrics or MIDI).
	Added string parsing optimizations
	Extreme file I/O optimizations for MIDI/ID3 import/export
	Implemented running status logic for MIDI/Vrhythm export that reduces filesize of the output MIDI track (and any track rewritten to remove vrhythm notes) by about 2 bytes per lyric and 2 more bytes per lyric/overdrive phrase (typical size reduction is around 10-20%)
	Added the id3tag parameter, allowing the contents of a file's ID3 tag to be displayed
	Added the nosrctag parameter, allowing all ID3 content or event just specific frames IDs to be omitted from the source file when the output file is created
	Removed = from the default filter list and disallowed it from being filtered, as this is intended to be a forced hyphen

	Added logic to add durations to lyrics that have other lyrics group onto them during ID3 import

Changelog: 2.01 to 2.1
	Changed logic so that equal signs in lyrics are exported regardless of the use of nohyphens, as they are intended to be visible hyphens
	Improved error logging of damaged MIDI files
	Added ability to parse "RIFF MIDI" (AKA RMIDI, RMI) files, which are regular MIDI files with an additional header

	Fixed a few memory leaks introduced by the new lyric detection logic
	Fixed a potential wild free that could occur in one of the string manipulation functions
	Fixed the logic for the updated -nohyphens usage where it wouldn't be accepted without a number unless nohyphens was the last parameter

	Reorganized program for inclusion in EOF
	Corrected grouping logic for KAR import
	Removed the extra "#newline" markup that was at the end of script export if -marklines was specified
	Pitchless formats (Script, VL, LRC and Soft Karaoke) are now stored internally as having no defined pitch instead of a generic pitch
	Fixed relative UltraStar import logic
	Fixed a bug with the UltraStar trailing whitespace logic that could cause grouping status to be lost
	Added logic to better allow pitch shift lyrics to be converted to "~" when hyphens weren't suppressed during UltraStar export
	Added the -relative parameter, allowing export of UltraStar lyrics in relative timing instead of absolute timing
	Fixed a bug that would cause the program to crash if exporting to a MIDI format, using a source MIDI, when the import file was not a MIDI based format
	Fixed a minor memory leak that could occur if importing a non MIDI based file and exporting to Vrhythm
	Removed "PART VOCALS" as a usable vocal rhythm track to ensure accuracy of lyric detection
	Added lyric format detection logic whose findings are given with verbose or debugging output.  If a lyric import is failing, you can use either of the logging features to see if you are specifying the correct import format for the given file.
	Corrected logic that handles the conversion between MIDI pitch numbering (Pitch 24 is note C1) and UltraStar pitch numbering (Pitch 0 is note C1)
	Rewrote pitch range validation to run only when the output format is MIDI, as only Rock Band MIDIs have a defined requirement of a vocal pitch range of [36,84].  Any vocal pitches outside of this range have their octave changed to correct the issue.
	Added logic to allow pitchless, durationless MIDI vocals (Lyric events with no Note On and Off) to be imported, also allowing them to be exported to MIDI (without vocal pitch notes, if the nopitch parameter is defined), UltraStar (as freestyle) and Vrhythm (as freestyle)
	Added the -nopitch parameter, which will cause imported pitchless lyrics (ie. VL, Script, LRC, Soft Karaoke, freestyle Pitched Lyric entries) to export to MIDI with no fake vocal notes, which also means that the affected lyrics will have no lyric durations

	Added support for exporting to (unofficial) KAR format, which Rock Band's MIDI format was derived from
	Removed some unused MIDI logic
	Fixed a bug with the nohyphens logic, which would automatically remove hyphens that were inserted if "-nohyphens 2" was used to suppress the pre-existing hyphens in the imported lyrics
	The -nohyphens parameter has been altered to allow it to be used without specifying a number after it, in which case "-nohyphens 3" is assumed, removing existing trailing hyphens and suppressing the automatic insertion of hyphens
	Made various code optimizations
	Fixed a bug in the KAR/MIDI import logic that could cause lyrics to lose their overdrive status
	Used Splint, Yasca and RATS security analysis tools to add some minor hardening to the source code
	Added more error checking

	Fixed a logic error that could cause the program to abort due to supposed invalid running status events, even if they were valid

Changelog: 1.95 to 1.96
	Corrected a bug that could produce unpredictable results when importing a relative timed UltraStar file that has a line break before the first lyric
	Added the -nolyrics parameter, allowing vocal pitches to be imported from a MIDI or KAR track that has no lyrics.  Exported lyrics use asterisks where lyrics would be but retain note pitches and timings.
	Added the ability to supply just the vrhythm track identifier instead of a pitched lyric file, allowing you to import a vrhythm file without lyrics and export back to vrhythm to create a pitched lyric file with the correct number of entries.
	Fixed a missing pointer assignment in the pitched lyric line break logic, which may have eventually allowed a crash to occur
	Increased error checking that occurs after lyric import
	Added new logic to exclude the imported vocal track from export to avoid duplicate vocal tracks when converting to and from MIDI based formats (vrhythm import is excluded from this logic)
	Added logic to correctly import MIDIs having the vocal track end in vocal phrases that have no lyrics defined (ie. tambourine sections)
	Due to errors in several Rock Band Network MIDIs, logic was altered to disregard lyric events that begin with an open bracket ( [ )

Changelog: 1.94 to 1.95
	Corrected a bug in the new source MIDI import logic that would import tracks from the input file instead of the source file
	Corrected a bug in the new source MIDI import logic that would cause the program to abort instead of process the file
	Corrected a false alarm that would claim that imported pitched lyrics had the wrong number of entries if the file ends in a blank line, even though all entries were properly loaded
	Corrected a bug that would cause duplicate track names if the source MIDI contained a track named the same as the one created to export vocal rhythm to
	Improved verbose output
	If exporting to a MIDI based format without merging with tracks from an existing source file, the created MIDI explicitly defines a tempo of 120BPM instead of using it implicitly
	Fixed the handling of the MIDI delay for MIDI based export format
	Fixed a minor memory leak that would occur if an input MIDI track name was specified
	Added the -outtrack parameter, allowing the destination track name for MIDI based exports to be specified
	Added logic to allow the -bpm parameter to specify the tempo used during MIDI based export if no source MIDI is given
	Based on Harmonix's documentation, I have altered program logic to recognize the expected range of pitches to be 36 to 84 (inclusive)

Changelog: 1.89 to 1.9
	Added support for exporting to extended LRC format
	During a vocal rhythm to MIDI conversion, the vocal rhythm notes are now removed from the exported MIDI.  All other notes retain their original timing

Changelog: 1.88 to 1.89
	Fixed a bug that would cause the program to crash if importing a pitched lyric file that ends in a phrase marker (hyphen).  This is now allowed, but a warning is given
	Moved some verbose output to the debug output option, and improved verbose output
	Added logic to warn if the given output filename doesn't have the appropriate extension
	Removed the requirement to use an undocumented parameter to export MIDI with correct pitches, as FoFiX 3.120 has fixed bugs that would have prevented custom vocal charts from working correctly
	Fixed a previous over-zealous commenting-out that broke the ability to load the artist tag during UltraStar import
	Added additional error output.  If a text input file (script, UltraStar, pitched lyric) has invalid number fields, the line containing the first error will be given
