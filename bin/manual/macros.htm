<h1><a name="Edit">What is this?</a></h1>
<blockquote>
The Notes panel is an additional informational panel that is meant for users to customize to display whatever information is wanted.  This is achieved by defining static text as well as various macros that will translate dynamically to text.  For the sake of this documentation, "printed" text will refer to the text that is written to the Notes panel.  Some of these macros are conditional, so you can control whether text or macros are displayed at all, such as to define content that will display only for the vocal track, or for content that will only display if a note is currently selected.  Content is defined line by line, where one line in the text file corresponds to a single line in the Notes panel.  Macros are case insensitive (you can use any amount of upper or lower case letters to type them), but it's recommended to use upper case to make it more easy to identify where macros occur int the notes.panel.txt file.  It's also generally more traditional to type macros in all capital letters.<br>
</blockquote>


<h1>Using the Notes panel</h1>
<blockquote>
A default notes.panel.txt file is provided with EOF.  It is a simple text file which can be viewed or edited in a text editor such as the Notepad utility that comes with Windows.  Keep in mind that this file is expected to be written in Windows format:  Line breaks are CR LF format (a carriage return character followed by a line feed character).  Decent text editors should allow you to save edits in this format, just make sure it isn't converted to Linux (line breaks only have a line feed character) or Unix (line breaks only have a carraige return character) format or it won't work properly.  To display or hide the Notes panel, use the <a href=functions.htm#enablenotespanel>File>Display>Enable Notes panel</a> function.  If it is shown, EOF will automatically resize the program window if doing so is needed to make enough space to display the panel.  If the Info panel or 3D preview are already being hidden (ie. from <a href=functions.htm#preferences>File>Preferences>Preferences</a>), EOF will use that empty space for the Notes panel and will prompt to resize the program window if the disabled Info/3D panels are re-enabled from Preferences while the Notes panel is being displayed (or if the Info panel is re-enabled via keyboard shortcut, EOF will resize the program window without prompting).  The Notes panel's contents are kept in EOF's memory to avoid having to read it from the computer's hard drive repeatedly, so if you make edits to the Notes panel, you can make them take effect in EOF by hiding the Notes panel and showing it again.  This causes EOF to re-load the notes.panel.txt file into memory.  Keep in mind that text that runs over the right edge of the Notes Window and into the 3D preview or the edge of the program window unless you either hide the 3D preview window or resize the program window (<a href=functions.htm#setdisplaywidth>File>Display>Set display width</a>).
</blockquote>


<h1>Printing static text</h1>
<blockquote>
The simplest thing to display would be static text, which prints exactly as typed in the notes.panel.txt file.  Alphabetical characters, numerical characters and spaces are supported.  Other characters aren't guaranteed to work.  Control characters like the tab character, for example, do not display.  Static text is mostly useful to display notes, to-do items, keyboard shortcuts, etc.
</blockquote>


<h1>Printing dynamic text</h1>
<blockquote>
Dynamic text is text that will change due to various defined conditions such as whether notes are selected, what kind of track is being displayed in the editor, etc.  For the Notes panel, this is achieved by using a "macro", which is basically a placeholder for what will eventually be "printed" to the Notes panel.  You can use this to display statuses of notes, conditions that may be in effect and other pieces of information.  EOF's macros always begin with a % (percent sign), end with % and never include any spaces.  If you want to print a percent sign to the Notes panel, a <b>%PERCENT%</b> macro can be used.  If there is an error in the notes.panel.txt file, the notes panel will indicate there was an unrecognized macro in that line.  If the unrecognized macro is specified as being <b>%ELSE%</b>, it's probably an error that needs to be corrected in EOF, otherwise it's most likely a typo in the notes.panel.txt file or a macro is being used that isn't supported by the version of EOF that you're using.  A complete list of all macros that EOF supports are defined <a href="macros.htm#macrolist">further down in this document</a>.  Feel free to request new macros to print specific items, which can be added to EOF if they would be useful or at least reasonably simple to implement.
</blockquote>


<h1>Comments</h1>
<blockquote>
Any line in notes.panel.txt that begins with a semicolon ; will be treated as a comment and no text or macros will be processed for that line.  No blank line will be printed, even if there is an %EMPTY% macro in the line.
</blockquote>


<h1>Conditional macros</h1>
<blockquote>
There are times where you may want to only display a certain piece of content under certain conditions.  For example, say you only wanted to print the shortcuts for toggling cymbal status when the drum track was active.  You could do this by adding the following text to the notes.panel.txt file:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_IS_DRUM_TRACK%</b>Toggle Y/B/G cymbal: CTRL+Y/B/G  Expert+ bass: CTRL+E</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Everything after the <b>%IF_IS_DRUM_TRACK%</b> will only print if that macro's condition is true:  That a drum track (either the normal one or the Phase Shift drum track) is the active track.  This way, you can display the shortcuts only when relevant and when a non drum track is active, that space can be used to display something else.  You can consider the part of the line that will print when the macro is evaluated as true as being the macro's "scope", which in this case is everything after the <b>%IF_IS_DRUM_TRACK%</b> macro up until the end of the line.<br><br>

In the previous example, everything after the <b>%IF_IS_DRUM_TRACK%</b> macro up until the end of the line in the notes.panel.txt file was conditional on the active track being a drum track and thus the macro being evaluated as being true.  A more complicated example is one where only part of a line is conditional.  An <b>%ENDIF%</b> macro can be placed after an <b>%IF...</b> macro to end its scope, stopping the conditional processing of the line in the notes.panel.txt file.  For example:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_NOTE_IS_SELECTED%</b>Note is selected at <b>%SELECTED_NOTE_POS%</b>.  <b>%ENDIF%</b>Seek position is <b>%SEEK_POSITION%</b>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this example, the "Note is selected at (position)" text is only printed if a note is selected.  The <b>%ENDIF%</b> macro indicates the end of the content that only prints if a note is selected, so the seek position is displayed regardless of whether a note is selected.  After conditional printing of a line is ended with <b>%ENDIF%</b>, another conditional macro can be used if desired.  For example:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_NOTE_IS_SELECTED%</b>Note selected.  <b>%ENDIF%</b>Seek position is <b>%SEEK_POSITION%</b>.  <b>%IF_NOTE_IS_SELECTED%</b>Selected note is at <b>%SELECTED_NOTE_POS%</b>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this example.  "Note selected."  only prints if a note is selected.  Then the seek position is printed regardless of whether a note is selected.  Then the selected note's position is printed only if a note is selected.  Keep in mind that some macros are only relevant in some conditions.  If the <b>%SELECTED_NOTE_POS%</b> macro is printed when no note is selected, the text "None" would be printed, and that might not always be what you want.  Conditionally printing such macros can be preferable if that's the result you're wanting to achieve.<br><br>

An even more complicated use of conditional macros is printing text when the conditional macro evaluates as false.  Similarly to <b>%ENDIF%</b>, the <b>%ELSE%</b> macro ends the scope of a conditional macro that evaluated as true.  However, everything in the scope of the <b>%ELSE%</b> macro is printed only if the previous conditional macro evaluated as false.  For example:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%COUNT_NOTES_SELECTED%</b> <b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b>Lyrics<b>%ELSE%</b>Notes<b>%ENDIF%</b> are selected.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this example, the number of notes/lyrics that are selected is printed, followed by a space.  Then if the vocal track is active, the text "Lyrics" is printed.  The <b>%ELSE%</b> macro defines what to print if the <b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b> condition was not true, so the text "Notes" is printed if the vocal track is not active.  As with previous examples, <b>%ENDIF%</b> ends the scope of the <b>%ELSE%</b> macro and defines where the true/false conditional printing stops and normal printing resumes, so the text " are selected." is then printed no matter which track is active.  Keep in mind that the printing of spaces can also be conditional, so place them either inside or outside conditional macro statements as appropriate.<br><br>

The most complex use of conditional macros is when a conditional macro is used inside the scope of another conditional macro.  This is known as "nesting" the conditional macros.  For example:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b><b>%IF_NOTE_IS_SELECTED%</b>At least one lyric is selected.<b>%ELSE%</b>No lyrics are selected.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this example, the first if macro is evaluated, and then only if it is true, the second if macro (which is nested one "level" deeper) is evaluated.  So if a vocal track is active, text will be printed indicating whether or not any lyrics are selected.  If a vocal track is not active, nothing is printed.  You can generally nest conditional macros as many levels as you want, just make sure to use the correct number and placement of %ENDIF% and %ELSE% macros to control the scope to get the desired results.  If you wanted to print text after the previous example even if the vocal track was not active, the scope of both conditional macros would have to be ended.  For example:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b><b>%IF_NOTE_IS_SELECTED%</b>At least one lyric is selected.  <b>%ELSE%</b>No lyrics are selected.  <b>%ENDIF%</b><b>%ENDIF%</b>This text always prints.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The first <b>%ENDIF%</b> macro ended the scope of <b>%IF_NOTE_IS_SELECTED%</b> that occurred immediately before it, and the second <b>%ENDIF%</b> macro ended the scope of the <b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b> macro even earlier.  Ultimately, "This text always prints." will be printed regardless of whether any lyrics are selected or whether the vocal track is even active.
</blockquote>


<h1>Printing empty lines</h1>
<blockquote>
If a defined line is empty or if all of the macros are conditional and none of the applicable requirements are met, nothing will display for it in the Notes panel, not even an empty line.  The text output position in the Notes panel will not advance, meaning the next line of content will be displayed immediately below the previous line of content that was written.  For example:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b>This is a vocal track</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the next line</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
If the current track is the vocal track, two lines will be written to the Notes panel ("This is a vocal track" and "This is the next line"), otherwise only the second of those two lines will be written and there will be no empty line.<br><br>

If you want to allow a line that results in no text (due to either being empty in the notes.panel.txt file or by no conditions being successfully met) to be written as an empty line in the Notes panel, use an <b>%EMPTY%</b> macro anywhere it will be sure to be processed instead of being within the scope of a macro that might not be used (before conditional macros or after all conditional macros were ended with <b>%ENDIF%</b>.  If you change it as follows:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b>This is a vocal track<b>%ENDIF%</b><b>%EMPTY%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the next line</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Everything from the <b>%IF_IS_VOCAL_TRACK%</b> macro until the end of the line in the notes.panel.txt file will only be processed if that condition (the current track is the vocal track) is met, or until an <b>%ELSE%</b> or <b>%ENDIF%</b> macro is reached on the same line.  Using <b>%ENDIF%</b> in this example allows the rest of the line to be processed so if the current track is NOT the vocal track, the <b>%EMPTY%</b> macro is still processed.  Since no text is being written for this line (none of it pertained to non vocal tracks), nothing is to be written for this line in the Notes panel, and the <b>%EMPTY%</b> macro that was processed indicates that the line is explicitly written to be empty in the panel so that the next text to be written to the panel will do so after a blank row.
</blockquote>


<a name="macrolist"><h1>Macro list</h1>
<blockquote>
These are all of the macros that can be used with the Notes panel.<br><br>
<b><u>Tip:</u></b>  Some web browsers will allow you to hold CTRL and left click on the macro name to highlight the entire name.  This makes it easier to copy to the clipboard and paste into the notes.panel.txt file in order to change what is to be displayed in the Notes panel.  CTRL+click the macro name again or click someplace else on the page in order to deselect it.

<tr>
<td>Macro name</td>
<td>Purpose</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%EMPTY%</td>
<td>If the line in notes.panel.txt did not result in any text to print for the line in the Notes panel, this macro allows an empty line to be printed to the Notes panel and the print position to be lowered so that the next line of printed text occurs below the empty space.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>%FLUSH%</td>
<td>Prints the content of the line that has been processed up to this point, then resumes processing the line.  Use this to print a line in progress so that a control macro such as %MOVE_DOWN_ONE_PIXEL% can take effect mid-line.</td>
</tr>
