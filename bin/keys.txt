After a song is opened or created you will need to know how to add, edit, move, and delete notes. The following keys will help you do that:


Playback and Seek controls:

    Space Bar:

        Play/Pause the currently loaded song
    
        Hold Ctrl when pressing Space to play at 50% speed

        Hold Ctrl and Shift when pressing Space to play at 25% speed

	Hold D when pressing Space to play at 100% speed
    
        Hold Shift when pressing Space to play the current fret catalog entry (see manual for
        information about the fret catalog).
        
        Hold S when pressing Space to play only the currently selected notes.  Keep S held
        down to cause the selected notes to replay on a loop once the last selected note is
        reached.
    

    Left/Right Arrow:

        Rewind or Fast Forward song.

        Hold Shift while pressing to move quickly.

        Hold both Ctrl and Shift while pressing to move very slowly (1ms at a time).

        (If Feedback input method is active, each left/right press seeks one grid
        snap backward/forward.)
    

    Page Up/Page Down:

        Move to the previous/next beat marker (moves to previous/next measure
        when Feedback input method is active).
    
        Hold Ctrl while pressing to seek to previous/next screen.
    
        Hold Shift while pressing to seek to previous/next note.

        Hold both Ctrl and Shift while pressing to seek to the previous/next grid snap
        position (when grid snap is enabled).

        Hold both Ctrl and Shift while pressing to seek to the previous/next anchor
        position (when grid snap is disabled).
        
        (If Feedback input method is active, Pg Up/Dn seeks one measure back/forward
         if there is a time signature in effect.)


    Numpad 0-9:
    
        Seek to the desired bookmark
        
        Hold Ctrl while pressing to place the desired bookmark at the current position


    Alt+Scroll wheel:

        Seek 5% of one screen forward or backward

        Toggle metronome.
    

    K:

        Toggle claps.

        Toggle vocal tones.
    

    ;/' (Semicolon/Apostrophe):

        Adjust audio playback rate in increments of 25%
        (or 10% if Feedback input method is active) if
        the chart is NOT playing, or 10% if the chart is
        playing.  Hold Ctrl while using these keys to
        change the playback rate in increments of 1%.


Note and Beat Editing:

    Right-Click/Insert (notes):

        Add a new note to the song, if Classic, Piano Roll
        or Hold input methods are used.  If SHIFT is held
        while clicking, a newly created note is given a
        a length of 1 millisecond, otherwise the length is
        determined by the current grid snap setting.
    

    Left-Click (notes):

        Select the highlighted note for editing
    
        Hold Ctrl while clicking to select multiple notes
    
        Hold Shift while clicking to select a range of notes


    Middle-Click (notes):

        Pro guitar track:

        Open the selected pro guitar notes in the edit pro guitar
        note dialog.  If no notes are selected, the note under
        the mouse when the middle click is performed is opened in
        the dialog.

        GHL track:

        If the mouse is hovering over an existing note, that note
        is converted to an open note if it isn't already one (if
        it is already one, the note is toggled off).  If the mouse
        is not hovering over an existing note, a new open note is
        placed.

        Vocal track:

        If the mouse is hovering over a lyric, the Edit Lyric
        dialog is opened for that lyric.

    Left-Click+Drag (notes):

        Move selected note(s)

    CTRL+[ , CTRL+]

        Move selected note(s) backward ([) or forward (]) by one
        grid snap.

    Mouse Wheel:

        Move up and down to lengthen or shorten the selected note
    
        You can also press the '[]' keys to do the same

	Turn off Grid Snap and hold Shift while lengthening/shortening for small adjustments.
	Hold both Ctrl and Shift while using the wheel to make even smaller adjustments.

	Holding Control while scrolling the mouse wheel increments/decrements the fret value
	for selected notes (pro guitar/bass tracks only).
    

    Up/Down:

        Transpose selected notes up/down.
    

    Left-Click (beats):

        Select the highlighted beat
    

    Left-Click+Drag (beats):

        Move the beat marker. An anchor is automatically created when you move a beat
        marker. Surrounding BPMs will be adjusted automatically. An anchor will not move
        unless dragged, nonanchor beats will adjust to fit.
    
        Hold Shift when dragging a beat to prevent the notes within from being adjusted with
        the beat markers. Useful if you are beat syncing someone elses songs, for instance. Shift
        has opposite effect when the "Note Auto-Adjust" preference is turned off.
    
        Hold Ctrl when dragging the first beat marker to leave all other beats in their current
        position.
    
        Hold Ctrl when dragging a beat marker that is both after the first beat marker and
        having no anchors after it in order to change the tempo of the anchor before it and
        leave the selected beat un-anchored.  This can be handy for syncing a beat map against
        the waveform graph.
    

    Right-Click (beats):

        Seek to the highlighted beat line.
    
    
    A:

        Toggle anchor for current beat.


    H:

        Cycle the HOPO status for the selected notes.

        Toggle the Pro drum cymbal notation for selected green drum notes.

        Pro guitar track:

        Enables ghost status for all gems of all selected notes.  This note mechanic is used for
        authoring real guitar transcriptions for Rock Band 3 and Phase Shift.


    Ctrl+Y:

        Toggle the Pro drum cymbal notation for selected yellow drum notes.


    Ctrl+B:

        Toggle the Pro drum cymbal notation for selected blue drum notes.


    Del

        Delete selected notes.

        Hold both Ctrl and Shift while deleting to perform the
	"Note>Delete>Delete w/ lower diffs" function.

    Tab:

        Cycle through difficulties.
    
        Hold Ctrl to cycle through the tracks.
    
        Hold shift in addition to Tab or Ctrl+Tab to cycle through difficulties or tracks in
        reverse.


    Ctrl+Shift+~ , Ctrl+Shift+#, Ctrl+Shift+Fn #:

        Changes the active difficulty to 0 (Ctrl+Shift+~), 1 through 10 (Ctrl+Shift+1 through 0),
        or 11 through 22 (Ctrl+Shift+F1 through F12). Difficulty levels higher than 4 are used to
        author tracks for Rocksmith.


    Ctrl+~ , Ctrl+#, Ctrl+Fn #, Ctrl+X:

        Changes the fret number for all gems of all selected notes to 0 (Ctrl+~), 1 through 10
        (Ctrl+1 through 0), or 11 through 22 (Ctrl+F1 through F12), or X (Ctrl+X, to denote string
        mutes).  These shortcuts are used for authoring real guitar transcriptions for Rock Band
        3, Phase Shift and Rocksmith.


    Comma/Period:

        Cycle through grid snap settings.

        pane shows preference.  If the eof_top_of_2d_pane_cycle_count_2 item is manually set
        to 1 in eof.cfg while EOF isn't running, the names and tones options are skipped by
        this shortcut.


EOF provides many useful functions which can be accessed through various menus and dialogs. Shortcuts keys are provided to access some of the more frequently used functions. This screen is not an exhaustive list of keyboard shortcuts. All menu functions with shortcuts will display that shortcut next to the name of the function in the menu.
