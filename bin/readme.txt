Description
-----------

EOF is a song editor for the game Frets On Fire. Since playing the game I have
wanted to make my own songs but I was disappointed in the usability of other
software. I set out to make my own editor that makes song creation easy.


Installation
------------

Just unzip the archive into a user-writeable folder. Do not install EOF into
your "Program Files" or other system folders, especially if you are using
Windows Vista or Windows 7 as EOF will need to be able to create and modify
files in the folder in which it resides.


Usage
-----

Upon opening the EOF executable you are presented with a blank screen. From
here you can load an existing song or create a new one. If you are unfamiliar
with EOF you should read the included manual by clicking "Help->Manual" in the
menu. You can also look at the basic control by clicking "Help->Keys" in the
menu.
