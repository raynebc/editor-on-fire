/*		LYRIC STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
Import functions are expected to:
	-Handle the offsetoverride parameter appropriately
	-Load tags appropriately
	-Track the start and end of lines of lyrics, overdrive paths, etc.
	-Map the pitch as values from 36-84 where 36 is a C note in the lowest octave used
	-Determine if there is variation in pitch, setting Lyrics.pitch_tracking if so
	-Round the non-floating point start, end and duration values appropriately
	-Provide any non-hyphen tracking for word grouping (ie whitespace prefix or suffix)
	-Call ForceEndLyricLine() or otherwise ensure that there's no open line of lyrics when the import completes
Lyric structure functions are expected to:
	-Remove leading/trailing whitespace for all lyric pieces
	-Detect pitch style
	-Handle the filter parameter appropriately
	-Set the grouping status for each lyric piece (VL import needs to supply some grouping information as it does not end partial words in hyphens by itself)
	-Handle the noplus parameter appropriately
	-Depending on noplus, append a hyphen at the end of a lyric piece that has a piece grouped after it (unless it already ends in a hyphen)
	-Handle the nohyphens parameter appropriately
	-Handle the startstamp parameter appropriately
	-Apply the offset if one was loaded by the import function
	-Handle overlapping lyrics or lyrics with a duration of 0
	-Perform grouping appropriately
	-Remap pitches appropriately if exporting to MIDI format
Export functions will expect the contents of the lyrics structure to be as follows:
	-No leading/trailing whitespace
	-If there is supposed to be whitespace between two lyric pieces, grouping for the piece will be 0
	-The style for each piece will be 0 for normal, '*' for golden/star power, 'F' for freestyle (freestyle takes priority over SP) or '!' for pitchless
	-'+' lyric pieces are stored by themselves with grouping set to nonzero (if it's the first piece in the line, grouping is off)
	-Hyphens have already been removed according to the nohyphens parameter
Export functions are expected to:
	-Round timestamps, durations, etc. where appropriate
	-Leave the contents of the Lyric structure unchanged where feasible (except for instances where the written lyric must be altered, such as to define grouping for SKAR export)
