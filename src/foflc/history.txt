Changelog: 2.39 to 2.40b (in progress)
	Improved UltraStar export so that if a lyric is pitchless, it is stored as a positive number instead of a negative number.
	Improved Ultrastar import to properly handle lyrics that have a negative timestamp but a large enough gap parameter to make them positive.
	Minor improvement to Rocksmith lyric detection by adding another criterion to identify such a file if the <xml> header tag is missing.
	Added handling for a rare problem that can affect the lyric import of MIDI based files.  This problem occurs when a MIDI file does not properly define a 0 byte length for the last end of track event, and subsequently the file would fail to parse.  Such MIDI files may even technically be violating the MIDI standard.
	Added a check to UltraStar lyric import to handle an invalid lyric duration of 0.
	Fixed a bug where timing conversion could malfunction on a MIDI that defines time signature changes in tracks other than the tempo track.
	Added support for importing line breaks in Rocksmith formatted lyrics and exporting line breaks in Rocksmith 2014 format.
	Improved the noplus logic so that a lyric's duration extends to the end of a pitch shift instead of simply having the shift's duration added.  Previously, the distance between the start of the pitch shift and the end of the previous lyric was not taken into account.
	Fixed a bug where the nolyrics parameter couldn't be specified without FoFLC reporting a usage error.
	Fixed a bug with Rocksmith imports where a numerical field larger than 10 digits long or a lyric longer than 100 characters would cause a buffer overflow.
	Fixed various memory leaks that could occur when parsing errors are encountered.
	Improved UltraStar import to skip the Byte Order Mark (BOM, a Unicode encoding mechanism) if one is present at the beginning of the imported file.  Previously the presence of the BOM would cause the import to fail.
	Improved LRC/ELRC import to allow the hundredths timing field to contain a third digit, in which case it will be interpreted as defining the field in milliseconds.
	Added an "ILRC" export variant of LRC format used for the Augmented Reality game IMMERROCK.
	Corrected the debug logging of MIDI files to correctly identify pitch bend events.
	Improved Rocksmith lyric import so that if there are no end of lyric line markers present (+ character at the end of lyrics), ends of lyric lines are added automatically based on letter capitalization and end of sentence punctuation (periods, question marks, exclamation marks).

Changelog: 2.38 to 2.39
	Some code cleanup.
	Added support for detecting, importing and exporting Rocksmith format lyrics.
	Minor improvements to MIDI parse logging and added a warning if no input track is specified during KAR import.
	Updated the MIDI format exports' logic so that if a default tempo track is created, it is given a track name based on the input song's title (otherwise "Tempo map" if there's no song title defined).  This may be necessary for some programs that use MIDI files.
	Added handling for improperly formatted MIDIs that don't formally end MIDI tracks, or which include data after the end of a track, either of which would cause such a MIDI to not parse fully during lyric import.

Changelog: 2.37 to 2.38
	Added support for detecting and importing JamBand format lyrics.
	Improved memory handling, including correcting a crash in the ID3v2 tag parsing that could occur during a parsing failure.
	Fixed a bug where export would fail if the input lyrics contained pitches but the first lyric was pitchless/freestyle.

Changelog: 2.36 to 2.37
	Added support for detecting and importing Guitar Praise format XML lyrics.
	Corrected memory leaks in the EOF integration.
	Corrected Vrhythm import for EOF integration.
	Corrected a crash that could occur during KAR import.
	Fixed a memory leak that would occur when using the id3tag parameter to display a file's ID3 tag.
	Fixed a memory leak that would occur if using the Track Event Parser to break upon reaching a meta event.
	Fixed a memory leak that would occur if only using the program to detect a file's lyric type.

Changelog: 2.35 to 2.36
	Improved debug logging for MIDI import
	Corrected the handling of Time Signature changes that weren't at the start of the imported MIDI

Changelog: 2.34 to 2.35
	Added support for importing/exporting SRT subtitle format
	Corrected grouping logic regarding the tracking of lyric durations
	Altered ID3 import logic to support all revisions of ID3v2 tags

Changelog: 2.33 to 2.34
	Changed the program executable's name to "foflc"
	Fixed a bug with the MIDI import's lyric overlap correction that would cause a lyric that overlapped into a new line phrase to be discarded
	Corrected the grouping behavior of pitch shifts, which now inherit the grouping of the lyric before them
	Altered the linker options for the program, as it seems that some GCC library wasn't being linked into the executable, resulting in a dll dependency
	Eliminated remaining use of calloc() in favor of guaranteed methods to initialize data to a value of 0
	Fixed a minor optimization warning given by GCC regarding some debug logging code
	Changed the import logic to not lengthen lyrics that precede a pitch shift unless the converter is being used outside of EOF
	Added logic so that vocal percussion notes can be loaded and passed to EOF

Changelog: 2.32 to 2.33
	Fixed a bug with the detection logic that could cause a crash during program completion if lyric detection was used and the input file had no lyrics
	Fixed a bug with ID3v1 tag creation that could write the wrong information into the tag fields
	Optimized ID3 output by using buffered copying for the MP3
	Added another song tag that will be used for import and export:  Year.  Currently, only the MIDI (song.ini) and ID3 formats routinely define this
	Optimized ID3 frame exclusion logic (excluding frames whose info. is defined in input file, or frames specified with nosrctag)
	Added additional logic so that the use of nosrctag as a wildcard will omit the ID3v1 tag contents from the source MP3
	Restored the ability to use the track "PART VOCALS" for vocal rhythm, since the detection logic now bases detection on more than the track name
	Lessened the use of calloc() to initialize allocated memory, as this could possibly cause a malfunction with some (currently unidentified) compilers or platforms that don't use all bits clear to represent 0 for some data types
	Made adjustments and a makefile for building in Windows, Mac and Linux

Changelog: 2.31 to 2.32
	Updated to GCC 4.5.0 and made minor changes to resolve compiler warnings
	Fixed a bug with ID3 parsing that wouldn't accept a frame that extended all the way to the end of the tag (ie. if it had no padding)
	Fixed a bug with the debug MIDI logging that displayed the realtime stamps of MIDI events incorrectly
	Fixed a bug with MIDI parsing that would likely have prevented a RIFF MIDI import from succeeding
	Fixed a bug with pitched lyric import that wouldn't allow note names A-1, A#-1 or B-1 to be imported
	Fixed a bug with the notenames handling that would cause pitch names for notes in octave -1 (pitches 0 through 11) to be written incorrectly (vrhythm export)
	Fixed a bug with the previous command line optimizations that would cause the program to try to load vocal rhythm from the pitched lyrics file instead of the MIDI file
	Fixed a file I/O error during ID3 import where the input file would be closed more than once if lyrics weren't found, resulting in the program detecting an error and aborting
	The syntax help output now displays the program version
	Added parameter checking to make sure nofstyle is only usable for MIDI export
	When the requested import fails, the detected format(s) of the input file are displayed
	Added the ability to automatically detect the import format if it is not specified
	File detection is now skipped unless detection is requested, if automatically detecting the input format or if the requested import fails
	Improved ELRC detection.  Even if the first lyric line in an LRC file has only one timestamp, other lines will be checked for the presence of multiple timestamps (ELRC)
	Added some more variable checking and ensured that all variables are now properly initialized, which should help prevent undiscovered bugs
	Consolidated debug output for MPEG frame parsing
	Added more error checking for each export format
	Added ability to import lyrics from a Rock Band Audition (RBA) file.  This container format includes a Rock Band style MIDI, and can be imported as "midi" format
	Improved validation of text information ID3v2 frames
	Added ability to read and write ID3v1 tag information

Changelog: 2.3 to 2.31
	Improved Rock Band MIDI detection, which now recognizes that whitespace in lyrics indicates KAR lyrics, because Rock Band lyrics don't use whitespace
	Sped up MIDI parsing by separating the statistics tracking used for lyric detection from the regular MIDI import code
	Corrected handling for a corrupted MIDI header that specifies fewer tracks than are defined in the file
	Removed some duplicated logic in the command line parsing code
	Added error checking for "rewind" file I/O operations
	Added the -nofstyle parameter to prevent the addition of freestyle characters during MIDI export

Changelog: 2.2 to 2.3
	Fixed memory leaks in UltraStar and ID3 imports
	Corrected program behavior to not create an empty output file during ID3 export if the source MP3 doesn't exist
	Added logic to track a lyric's overdrive and freestyle status separately.  Lyrics that import as both freestyle AND overdrive will export as such whenever possible (pitched lyrics or MIDI).
	Added string parsing optimizations
	Extreme file I/O optimizations for MIDI/ID3 import/export
	Implemented running status logic for MIDI/Vrhythm export that reduces filesize of the output MIDI track (and any track rewritten to remove vrhythm notes) by about 2 bytes per lyric and 2 more bytes per lyric/overdrive phrase (typical size reduction is around 10-20%)
	Added the id3tag parameter, allowing the contents of a file's ID3 tag to be displayed
	Added the nosrctag parameter, allowing all ID3 content or event just specific frames IDs to be omitted from the source file when the output file is created
	Removed = from the default filter list and disallowed it from being filtered, as this is intended to be a forced hyphen
	Added ability to load song tag information (artist, title, album) during ID3 import
	Fixed logic errors in the noplus parameter handling
	Fixed logic errors in duplicate tag import handling
	Added logic to export song tag information from the input file during ID3 export
	Added logic to allow the input MP3 to be assumed as the source MP3 during ID3 export if the source MP3 is not given

Changelog: 2.1 to 2.2
	Added additional logic to parse an extended ID3 header if present in the input MP3 file during ID3 import
	Corrected the import of ID3 lyrics that use MPEG timing
	Added support for exporting ID3 lyrics to an MPEG audio file (ie. MP3)
	Improved debug output
	Corrected some logic that could cause a crash when importing bizarre lyrics, such as if multiple lines' worth of lyrics shared the same timestamp
	Improved command line parameter validation
	Added logic to add durations to lyrics that have other lyrics group onto them during ID3 import

Changelog: 2.01 to 2.1
	Changed logic so that equal signs in lyrics are exported regardless of the use of nohyphens, as they are intended to be visible hyphens
	Improved error logging of damaged MIDI files
	Added ability to parse "RIFF MIDI" (AKA RMIDI, RMI) files, which are regular MIDI files with an additional header
	Added ability to detect and import synchronized lyrics from the ID3 tag of an MP3 file

Changelog: 2.0 to 2.01
	Fixed the behavior of the -quick parameter
	Corrected the logging to show the results of the lyric detection if verbose/debugging logging is enabled
	Added logic to correct problems with an imported MIDI that has overlapping line phrases, a formatting error that plagued just under 5% of all RB MIDIs.
	Allowed an imported MIDI/KAR file to violate the KAR standard by having a note's pitch at a different MIDI timing than its lyric.  So far, the only MIDI that seems to violate this is "Kasabian - Shoot The Runner"
	Fixed a few memory leaks introduced by the new lyric detection logic
	Fixed a potential wild free that could occur in one of the string manipulation functions
	Fixed the logic for the updated -nohyphens usage where it wouldn't be accepted without a number unless nohyphens was the last parameter

Changelog: 1.96 to 2.0
	Improved parameter conflict detection
	Improved readme file
	Added the -notenames parameter, allowing the exported pitched lyric file to be written in note names instead of numbers (ie. A#7 instead of 106)
	Reorganized program for inclusion in EOF
	Corrected grouping logic for KAR import
	Removed the extra "#newline" markup that was at the end of script export if -marklines was specified
	Pitchless formats (Script, VL, LRC and Soft Karaoke) are now stored internally as having no defined pitch instead of a generic pitch
	Fixed relative UltraStar import logic
	Fixed a bug with the UltraStar trailing whitespace logic that could cause grouping status to be lost
	Added logic to better allow pitch shift lyrics to be converted to "~" when hyphens weren't suppressed during UltraStar export
	Added the -relative parameter, allowing export of UltraStar lyrics in relative timing instead of absolute timing
	Fixed a bug that would cause the program to crash if exporting to a MIDI format, using a source MIDI, when the import file was not a MIDI based format
	Fixed a minor memory leak that could occur if importing a non MIDI based file and exporting to Vrhythm
	Removed "PART VOCALS" as a usable vocal rhythm track to ensure accuracy of lyric detection
	Added lyric format detection logic whose findings are given with verbose or debugging output.  If a lyric import is failing, you can use either of the logging features to see if you are specifying the correct import format for the given file.
	Corrected logic that handles the conversion between MIDI pitch numbering (Pitch 24 is note C1) and UltraStar pitch numbering (Pitch 0 is note C1)
	Rewrote pitch range validation to run only when the output format is MIDI, as only Rock Band MIDIs have a defined requirement of a vocal pitch range of [36,84].  Any vocal pitches outside of this range have their octave changed to correct the issue.
	Added logic to allow pitchless, durationless MIDI vocals (Lyric events with no Note On and Off) to be imported, also allowing them to be exported to MIDI (without vocal pitch notes, if the nopitch parameter is defined), UltraStar (as freestyle) and Vrhythm (as freestyle)
	Added the -nopitch parameter, which will cause imported pitchless lyrics (ie. VL, Script, LRC, Soft Karaoke, freestyle Pitched Lyric entries) to export to MIDI with no fake vocal notes, which also means that the affected lyrics will have no lyric durations
	Improved the MIDI lyric error recovery logic's handling of corrected endings of lyric phrases
	Corrected the program's logic regarding calculation of lyric line durations
	Fixed logic errors with the combined use of nohyphens and noplus

	Added more error handling and statistic tracking (lyric count) in MIDI parsing code
	Added support for exporting to (unofficial) KAR format, which Rock Band's MIDI format was derived from
	Removed some unused MIDI logic
	Fixed a bug with the nohyphens logic, which would automatically remove hyphens that were inserted if "-nohyphens 2" was used to suppress the pre-existing hyphens in the imported lyrics
	The -nohyphens parameter has been altered to allow it to be used without specifying a number after it, in which case "-nohyphens 3" is assumed, removing existing trailing hyphens and suppressing the automatic insertion of hyphens
	Made various code optimizations
	Fixed a bug in the KAR/MIDI import logic that could cause lyrics to lose their overdrive status
	Used Splint, Yasca and RATS security analysis tools to add some minor hardening to the source code
	Added more error checking
	Added the -detect parameter, which will detect and list the lyric format(s) of the specified file instead of performing a lyric import or export
	Added logic to perform correction for malformed RB MIDIs that have empty lyric phrases (ie. Queen - "We Will Rock You")
	Fixed a logic error that could cause the program to abort due to supposed invalid running status events, even if they were valid

Changelog: 1.95 to 1.96
	Corrected a bug that could produce unpredictable results when importing a relative timed UltraStar file that has a line break before the first lyric
	Added the -nolyrics parameter, allowing vocal pitches to be imported from a MIDI or KAR track that has no lyrics.  Exported lyrics use asterisks where lyrics would be but retain note pitches and timings.
	Added the ability to supply just the vrhythm track identifier instead of a pitched lyric file, allowing you to import a vrhythm file without lyrics and export back to vrhythm to create a pitched lyric file with the correct number of entries.
	Fixed a missing pointer assignment in the pitched lyric line break logic, which may have eventually allowed a crash to occur
	Increased error checking that occurs after lyric import
	Added new logic to exclude the imported vocal track from export to avoid duplicate vocal tracks when converting to and from MIDI based formats (vrhythm import is excluded from this logic)
	Added logic to correctly import MIDIs having the vocal track end in vocal phrases that have no lyrics defined (ie. tambourine sections)
	Due to errors in several Rock Band Network MIDIs, logic was altered to disregard lyric events that begin with an open bracket ( [ )

Changelog: 1.94 to 1.95
	Corrected a bug in the new source MIDI import logic that would import tracks from the input file instead of the source file
	Corrected a bug in the new source MIDI import logic that would cause the program to abort instead of process the file
	Corrected a false alarm that would claim that imported pitched lyrics had the wrong number of entries if the file ends in a blank line, even though all entries were properly loaded
	Corrected a bug that would cause duplicate track names if the source MIDI contained a track named the same as the one created to export vocal rhythm to
	Improved verbose output
	If exporting to a MIDI based format without merging with tracks from an existing source file, the created MIDI explicitly defines a tempo of 120BPM instead of using it implicitly
	Fixed the handling of the MIDI delay for MIDI based export format
	Fixed a minor memory leak that would occur if an input MIDI track name was specified
	Added the -outtrack parameter, allowing the destination track name for MIDI based exports to be specified
	Added logic to allow the -bpm parameter to specify the tempo used during MIDI based export if no source MIDI is given
	Based on Harmonix's documentation, I have altered program logic to recognize the expected range of pitches to be 36 to 84 (inclusive)

Changelog: 1.93 to 1.94
	Finished removing previous KAR import logic
	Improved efficiency of MIDI and Vrhythm export code
	Added logic to disable appending a hyphen to a lyric if the following lyric is just a pitch shift (+ character), regardless of nohyphens setting

	Fixed a logic error that could cause the program to abort itself at the end if the input or source MIDI file did not explicitly set a tempo
	Made the source MIDI file optional for MIDI and Vrhythm export.  If not used, the exported file uses a default tempo of 120BPM

	Added whitespace logic allowing either leading OR trailing whitespace to separate whole words during UltraStar import

Changelog: 1.92 to 1.93
	Added support for exporting to Vocal Rhythm format
	Added support for writing flat note notation for Vrhythm import
	Added handling for lyrics that end in a forward slash (ie. in Rock Band Beatles MIDIs) to cause a line break to occur

	Added strong handling for incorrectly nested notes in KAR files
	Improved error handling for remaining file I/O (file open/read/write/close/flush)
	Combined new KAR import logic with RB MIDI import logic for simplification

Changelog: 1.89 to 1.9
	Added support for exporting to extended LRC format
	During a vocal rhythm to MIDI conversion, the vocal rhythm notes are now removed from the exported MIDI.  All other notes retain their original timing
	Added handling for empty line phrases during pitched lyric import, allowing the first line of lyrics to contain overdrive
	Fixed a minor logic flaw caused by importing empty lyric lines in LRC format
	Added error checking for almost all file I/O operations

Changelog: 1.88 to 1.89
	Fixed a bug that would cause the program to crash if importing a pitched lyric file that ends in a phrase marker (hyphen).  This is now allowed, but a warning is given
	Moved some verbose output to the debug output option, and improved verbose output
	Added logic to warn if the given output filename doesn't have the appropriate extension
	Removed the requirement to use an undocumented parameter to export MIDI with correct pitches, as FoFiX 3.120 has fixed bugs that would have prevented custom vocal charts from working correctly
	Fixed a previous over-zealous commenting-out that broke the ability to load the artist tag during UltraStar import
	Added additional error output.  If a text input file (script, UltraStar, pitched lyric) has invalid number fields, the line containing the first error will be given
	Fixed a logic flaw causing the source MIDI to be processed twice if converting from Vocal Rhythm to MIDI
	Fixed overdrive and freestyle logic for pitched vocal import
	Added logic to remove trailing whitespace from lyrics during pitched lyric import

Changelog: 1.63 to 1.7
	Added capability to export to VL format
	Fixed a bug that caused incorrect note timing when the brute parameter is used

Changelog: 1.62 to 1.63

	Replaced all single precision floating point variables with double precision floating point
	Added a brute parameter that checks all tempos from 200-400bpm in increments of .01 to find the most accurate tempo for ustar export.
	Fixed a bug with UltraStar export that would cause the program to abort when exporting all-freestyle songs
	UltraStar export code now uses double precision floating point variables for additional accuracy

Changelog: 1.61 to 1.62
